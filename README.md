## 🎯 Quick Pitch (60 seconds)

This project demonstrates a **production-style load balancer built from the ground up in Node.js** without relying on nginx or cloud services. It intercepts client traffic, checks backend health, applies pluggable algorithms (Round Robin, Least Connections), and forwards requests to available servers. Perfect for learning distributed systems, interview prep, or prototyping custom routing logic.

**Key takeaway:** I'll see how real load balancers work internally—health checks, metrics tracking, algorithm selection, and transparent proxying—all implemented in clean, readable JavaScript.
